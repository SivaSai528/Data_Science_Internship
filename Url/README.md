URL Shortener Web Application (Advance)
Project Workflow
1. During signup, the user has to enter a unique username. If he enters 
a username which is already taken then an error message will occur 
displaying “This username already exists…” Then the user needs to 
enter another username. The length of the username is valid only in 
the range of 5 and 9. If the username is not of valid length, then an 
error message will occur: “Username must be between 5 to 9 
characters long”.
2. After logging in, the main web-application opens which is the URL 
shortener. Here the user can enter the URL he wants to shorten. 
After entering a URL, click on the ‘shorten’ URL button to display the 
shortened URL in the following text-field which can be copied by 
clicking on the copy button.
3. After the ‘shorten’ button is clicked, the URL that is entered is saved 
in our database with the shortened URL. It is saved in the database 
so that the user can look into the previous URLs he entered in our 
web-app with their shortened URL in the forms given below the copy 
button.
